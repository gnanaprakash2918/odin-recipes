            Lasagna is the name of one of the oldest and best-known pasta
            shapes. It is usually rectangular or ribbon shaped, thicker than
            tagliatelle, made from a dough based on flour and eggs, with
            numerous local variants. After being boiled, the rectangular lasagna
            noodles are drained and placed in layers with a filling that varies
            based on different local traditions.

            A grilled cheese is a hot sandwich typically prepared by heating one
            or more slices of cheese between slices of bread, with a cooking fat
            such as butter or mayonnaise on a frying pan, griddle, or sandwich
            toaster, until the bread browns and the cheese melts.

            A hamburger, or simply burger, is a food consisting of
            fillings—usually a patty of ground meat, typically beef—placed
            inside a sliced bun or bread roll. A burger is a flat round mass of
            minced meat or vegetables, which is fried and often eaten in a bread
            roll. It is a hot sandwich made with buttered and toasted bread and
            originally filled with American cheese, but is now commonly made
            with one or more different cheeses.
