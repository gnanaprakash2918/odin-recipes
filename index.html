            Lasagna is the name of one of the oldest and best-known pasta
            shapes. It is usually rectangular or ribbon shaped, thicker than
            tagliatelle, made from a dough based on flour and eggs, with
            numerous local variants. After being boiled, the rectangular lasagna
            noodles are drained and placed in layers with a filling that varies
            based on different local traditions.

            A grilled cheese is a hot sandwich typically prepared by heating one
            or more slices of cheese between slices of bread, with a cooking fat
            such as butter or mayonnaise on a frying pan, griddle, or sandwich
            toaster, until the bread browns and the cheese melts.
